Analysis Results:

* FBA Sellers: Joining Amazon as an FBA (Fulfilled by Amazon) seller seems more logical as it increases the likelihood of receiving orders.
  
Note: According to additional research, AMZ types are products sold directly by Amazon, while individuals can join as FBA or FBM (Fulfilled by Merchant) sellers.

* Product Selection: Choosing products with 4 or 5-star ratings increases the likelihood of successful orders.

* Optimal Joining Time: Sellers should consider joining Amazon in September, October, or November for better results.

* Product Profitability: It is risky to sell products with negative profits; therefore, products with positive profits should be selected .

* Shipping Type: Choose the shipping type that aligns with your plan in terms of time and cost .
